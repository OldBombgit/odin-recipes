    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup semolina flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>12 sheets phyllo dough</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 cup sugar, semolina, cornstarch, and salt together in a medium bowl until no cornstarch clumps
            remain.</li>
        <li>Bring milk to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Gradually stir in semolina mixture with a wooden
            spoon. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from the heat and
            keep warm.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed. Add 1/2 cup sugar and beat for a full 10
            minutes until thick and pale. Stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Fold mixture into the hot semolina mixture. Partially cover the pan and set aside to cool. Preheat the oven
            to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place one phyllo sheet into the pan and brush with melted butter; repeat
            with six more sheets.</li>
        <li>Pour custard into the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining phyllo sheets, one at a time, brushing each with butter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is crisp and custard filling has set, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the custard is just about finished baking, stir remaining 1 cup sugar and water together in a small
            saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Remove custard from the oven and spoon hot syrup over top, particularly around the edges.</li>
        <li>Let cool to room temperature, then cut into 16 squares and serve.</li>
    </ol>
